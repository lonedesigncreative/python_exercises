# 1 - Print

## What it is:  
`print` is a command that shows something on the screen.

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Always use parentheses** → print("Hello")
> - Text must be inside quotes `" "`
> - Missing quotes or parentheses causes an error.

**Example:**
`print("Python!")`

This will display:
- *Python!*


# 2 - Decimal (in Python called float)

## What it is:  
A decimal number - a number with a dot (.).

> [!CAUTION]
> - Python uses a dot, not a comma.
> - 3.5 is correct, 3,5 is wrong.

**Example:**
`price = 3.50`


# 3 - Text (in Python called string)

## What it is:  
Text inside quotes `" "`.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Text must always be inside quotes.
> - If you put numbers inside quotes, they become text, not numbers.

**Example:**
`name = "LoneDesign"`

# Summary

| **Concept** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| print | hows something on the screen | print("Hi") |
| integer | Whole number | 10 |
| decimal (float) | Number with decimal | 2.5 |
| text (string) | Words inside quotes | "Hello" |


# 4 - Input

## What it is:  
`input` is a command that **asks the user to type something**.

> [!CAUTION]
> - `input` always returns text, even if the user types a number.
> - If you want a number, you must convert it.

**Example:**
`name = input("Enter your name: ")`


# 5 - Addition (`+`)

## What it does:  
Adds two values.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Only works correctly with numbers.
> - If you add text, Python will join the words instead of doing math.

**Example:**
`total = 5 + 3`


# 6 - Subtraction (`−`)

## What it does:  
Subtracts one value from another.

> [!CAUTION]
> - You cannot subtract text.
> - You cannot subtract using commas (European style). Use dots.

**Example:**
`difference = 10 - 4`

# 7 - Multiplication (`*`)

## What it does:  
Multiplies two values.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Multiplying text repeats it.

**Example:**
`product = 6 * 2`


# 8 - Division (`/`)

## What it does:  
Divides one value by another.
Always returns a decimal (float).

> [!CAUTION]
> - Division always returns a decimal (float).
> - Be careful with dividing by zero - it causes an error.

**Example:**
`result = 10 / 4   # 2.5`


# 9 - `==`

## What it is:  
The `==` operator checks if two values are exactly the same.
It returns True when the values are equal and False when they are different.

  - `==` → compares values
  - It does not assign values (that’s =)

> [!CAUTION]
> - **== is not =**
>   - = assigns a value; == compares values.
> - **Compare compatible types**
>     - avoid comparing numbers with text ("10" == 10 is False).
> - **Becareful with `input()`**
>     - input returns text, so convert before comparing (`int(input())`).
> - **Case sensitivity matters**
>     - `"Ana" == "ana"` is False because the letters are different.
> - **Spacing matters** —
>   - write `a == 10`, not `a==10abc`.

**Example:**
`age = 18`
`print(age == 18)`   # True

`score = 50`
`print(score == 60)` # False


# 10 - f-string (f"")

## What it is:
An f string is a special type of text that allows you to insert variables inside the text.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Don’t forget the **f** before the quotes.
> - Without the **f**, Python will not replace the variables.

You write it with the letter f before the quotes:
`f"Hello {name}"`


# 11 - { }
## What it means:
The `{ }` are used to show the value of a variable inside the text.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Inside `{ }` you must put a **variable** or an **expression**.
> - If you put text without quotes, it gives an error.
> - If you put quotes inside `{ }`, it becomes text again.

**Example:**
`age = 25`
`print(f"You are {age} years old")`

Python replaces {age} with the value of the variable.

# Summary

| **Concept** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| input | Asks the user to type something | `input("Your name: ")` |
| f-string | Text that can show variables | `f"Hello {name}"` |
| { } | Shows the variable’s value inside the f string | `{age}` |


# 12 - `If`

## What it is:  
An **if** statement checks a condition.
If the condition is **true**, the code inside **runs**.
If the condition is **false**, Python **skips it**.

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Indentation is required** → the code inside the `if` must be indented.
> - **If without else does nothing when false** → the program continues normally.
> - **Condition must be valid** → avoid writing text or invalid expressions inside the `if`.
> - **B****e careful with spacing** → `if age >= 18`: works, but `ifage>=18`: is invalid.

**Example:**
`score = 90`
`if score >= 80:`
   `print("Great job")`


# 13 - `Elif`

## What it is:  
**elif** means **“else if”**.
It is used when you want to check another condition after the first `if`.

  - `if` → first condition
  - `elif` → second condition (only checked if the first is false)
  - `else` → runs when all previous conditions are false

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Elif must come after an if** → you cannot start with `elif`.
> - **Order matters** → Python checks conditions from top to bottom.
> - **Only one block runs** → once one condition is true, the rest are skipped.
> - **Indentation is required** → keep the structure clean.

**Example:**
`score = 75`

`if score >= 90:`
    `print("Excellent")`
`elif score >= 70:`
    `print("Good")`
`else:`
    `print("Needs improvement")`


# 14 - `Else`

## What it is:  
The **else** block runs **when the if condition is false**.
It is the “backup” or “alternative” action.

  - **if** = what happens when the condition is true
  - **else** = what happens when the condition is false

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Else must come after an if** → you cannot use `else` alone.
> - **Indentation is required** → the code inside `else` must be indented.
> - **Else has no condition** → it runs automatically when the `if` is false.
> - **Avoid unnecessary else** → use it only when you really need an alternative action.
- **Be careful with `input()`** → convert values before comparing in the `if`.

**Example:**
`age = 16`

`if age >= 18:`
    `print("You can enter")`
`else:`
    `print("You cannot enter")`
