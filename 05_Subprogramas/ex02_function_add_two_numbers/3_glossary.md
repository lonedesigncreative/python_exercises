# 1 - Print

## What it is:  
`print` is a command that shows something on the screen.

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Always use parentheses** → print("Hello")
> - Text must be inside quotes `" "`
> - Missing quotes or parentheses causes an error.

**Example:**
`print("Python!")`

This will display:
- *Python!*

# 2 - Decimal (in Python called float)

## What it is:  
A decimal number - a number with a dot (.).

> [!CAUTION]
> - Python uses a dot, not a comma.
> - 3.5 is correct, 3,5 is wrong.

**Example:**
`price = 3.50`



# 3 - Text (in Python called string)

## What it is:  
Text inside quotes `" "`.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Text must always be inside quotes.
> - If you put numbers inside quotes, they become text, not numbers.

**Example:**
`name = "LoneDesign"`

# Summary

| **Concept** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| print | hows something on the screen | print("Hi") |
| integer | Whole number | 10 |
| decimal (float) | Number with decimal | 2.5 |
| text (string) | Words inside quotes | "Hello" |


# 4 - Addition (`+`)

## What it does:  
Adds two values.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Only works correctly with numbers.
> - If you add text, Python will join the words instead of doing math.

**Example:**
`total = 5 + 3`


# 5 - Input

## What it is:  
`input` is a command that **asks the user to type something**.

> [!CAUTION]
> - `input` always returns text, even if the user types a number.
> - If you want a number, you must convert it.

**Example:**
`name = input("Enter your name: ")`



# 6 - def

## What it is:  
`def` is a Python keyword used to define a function.

>> “Create a reusable block of code with a name.”

A function lets you:
- organize code
- avoid repetition
- receive inputs
- return outputs


> [!NOTE]
> ### Basic structure:
>    - `def function_name(parameters):`
>    - `code_block`
> **Example:**
>    - `def greet():`
>      - `print("Hello!")`



> [!IMPORTANT]
> **## What def does**
> - Creates a function
> - Gives it a name
> - Defines parameters
> - Defines the code that runs when the function is called


> [!TIP]
> **## Why functions are useful**
> - Avoid repeating code
> - Make programs easier to read
> - Allow modular programming
> - Allow reuse in different parts of the program

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Indentation is required** → code inside the function must be indented.
> - **Functions must be called** → defining is not enough.
> - **Return ends the function** → anything after return is ignored.
> - **Parameters must match** → wrong number of arguments gives error.
> - **Functions create their own scope** → variables inside are local.


**Example:**
*Example 1 - Function with no parameters*
`def say_hello():`
  `print("Hello, John!")`

Call it:
> say_hello()

*Example 2 - Function with one parameter*
`def greet(name):`
  `print("Hello", name)`

Call it:
> greet("Ana")
